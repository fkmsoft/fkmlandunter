INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

To build the Fkmlandunter package, edit the Makefile to your liking (especially
changing the value PREFIX and/or DESTDIR) and make sure you have the following
installed on your system:

check
python
pyqt4 (plus development files)
ncurses (plus development headers)
sdl (plus development headers)
sdl_net (plus development headers)
sdl_image (plus development headers)
sdl_ttf (plus development headers)

you can then build and install everything using

$ make all

and

$ su -c "make install"

or

$ sudo make install

This will install several binaries in `PREFIX/bin/', all starting with
`fkmlandunter'. Among these, two are symlinks - `fkmlandunter' links to
`fkmlandunter_client_sdl' by default, you can point it to another fkmlandunter
client if you prefer, and `fkmlandunter_srv' pointing to `fkmlandunter_srv_new'
by default, you can point it to the old server implementation
`fkmlandunter_srv_old' instead.

All data files (mostly .pngs used to render the surface of the sdl client) can
be found in `PREFIX/share/fkmlandunter/data/'. In this directory you can also
find an example configuration file for the sdl client.
